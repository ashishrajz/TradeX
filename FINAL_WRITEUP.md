# üß© TRADEX ‚Äì Final Technical Writeup

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Overview

**TRADEX** is a full-fledged **virtual trading and strategy testing platform** built to simulate trading without real money. It allows users to create and test their own strategies via **backtesting** and **live Copilot mode**, which connects to user-hosted Strategy APIs.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ System Architecture & Design

### üß± Components

| Layer | Technology | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js, SWR, Recharts, Clerk | Interactive UI for strategy management, backtesting visualization, and live monitoring. |
| **Backend** | Node.js (Next.js API Routes) | Provides endpoints for user management, backtesting, and data aggregation. |
| **Database** | MongoDB (Mongoose) | Stores user data, strategies, backtests, and live runs. |
| **Cache** | Redis | Caches Binance candle data to reduce latency and API load. |
| **Worker** | Node.js Background Service | Executes trades in Copilot mode by calling strategy APIs and updating equity. |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Data Flow

User ‚Üí Web UI ‚Üí Next.js API ‚Üí MongoDB
‚Üò‚Üí Redis Cache
‚Üò‚Üí Background Worker ‚Üí Strategy API


### üîÑ Worker Flow
1. Fetch active runs from MongoDB.  
2. Fetch live price from Binance.  
3. Send data to user‚Äôs strategy API.  
4. Execute BUY/SELL trades accordingly.  
5. Store new trades & equity snapshots.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Core Functionalities

### üß† Part A: Backtesting Engine
- Fetches OHLC data from Binance.
- Evaluates indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, PRICE).
- Simulates trades with initial capital.
- Returns **equity curve + trades + candle data**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Part B: Copilot Mode
- Runs live worker that periodically polls prices.
- Integrates with **user-hosted Strategy API**.
- Records trades and live equity snapshots in MongoDB.
- Visualizes in real time on frontend dashboard.

### ü™Ñ AI Suggestion Layer
- AI-assisted indicator selection and strategy condition generation via OPUS AI integration.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Innovation Layer
- **Pluggable Strategy API:**  
  Users can deploy their own custom API endpoints (e.g., hosted on Render).  
  TRADEX automatically connects and sends live data during both backtest and Copilot modes.

- **No-Code Strategy Builder:**  
  Interactive interface to define trading rules visually.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Challenges & Learnings

| Challenge | Solution |
|------------|-----------|
| Render shutting down worker | Added UptimeRobot pings to keep it alive |
| Data delays from Binance | Implemented Redis caching and mirror endpoint |
| Strategy debugging | Added verbose logs for backtest + Copilot |
| State management | SWR hooks for live refreshing UI |
| Trade synchronization | MongoDB atomic updates per run |

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Learnings & Improvements
- Learned how to design **modular trading architecture**.
- Optimized strategy evaluation for scalability.
- Improved code modularity between backtest and live runs.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Cost Estimation
| Component | Provider | Monthly Cost |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| Render (Web + Worker) | Render | ~$10 |
| MongoDB Atlas | Free Tier | $0 |
| Redis (Upstash) | Free Tier | $0 |
| Clerk Auth | Free Plan | $0 |
| **Total** |  | **‚âà $10/month** |

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Future Enhancements
- Machine Learning-driven signal generation.
- Marketplace for sharing and selling strategies.
- Multi-asset portfolio tracking.
